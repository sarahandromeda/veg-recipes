## Two Ways to Cook Great Potatoes

### Par Boiling

> Parboiling the potatoes before you fry them in a pan helps keep the potatoes from sticking to the pan.

1. Cut potatoes to desired size (about 1" cubed is best)
2. Bring pot of water to a boil
    - You can add a veggie broth, rosemary, or any other flavorings to the water if you'd like.
3. Add potatoes and boil for about 10 min
    - You want the potatoes just soft enough that a fork will go through without much effort
    - If you boil them too long they'll turn into mashed potatoes!
4. Strain out potatoes and let dry for a minute or so
5. Heat a pan to medium heat with oil or butter, making sure that the oil or butter is HOT before adding potatoes
    - Butter or oil should be just barely smoking or shimmery 
    - You can try dropping one potato in the pan, as a pilot and making sure it has a nice, immediate sizzle
6. Once pan is hot, add potatoes, making sure they each have a side down on the pan, and let them fry, without touching them, until the side with contact is browned.
7. Flip potatoes and continue frying until all potatoes are nice and browned
    - When the potatoes are close to being done, you can start to season them
        - If you are going to add garlic powder, don't add it in until you are ready to take the potatoes out, as it will burn being in the pan for more than 10 seconds.
- We like to fry onions and bell peppers with them. If you want to, add the peppers first after you lay out the potatoes in step 6. Add the onions after the first flip in step 7. By the time the potatoes are done, the peppers and onions should be cooked through.
    - Alternately you can fry the onions and peppers by themselves and add them in at the end.


### Air Frying

> If you have an air-fryer, this is our preferred method.

1. Cut potatoes to desired size (about 1" cubed is best)
2. Mix potatoes in a bowl with desired seasonings, leaving out SALT and GARLIC
    - Salt can cause the potatoes to dry out too much and the garlic will burn
3. When you are ready to add potatoes to the air fryer, cover with a little bit of cooking oil
    - Do this right before you put the potatoes in the fryer. If you let them sit in the oil too long before cooking, they will absorb the oil and cook weird.
4. Depending on your air fryer, cooking times and temp may be different. Check online for the best way to cook them in your air fryer.
    - For us, 400 for 15-20 minutes usually does the trick
    - If you have an air fryer with a single basket, make sure you stir the potatoes at some point during the cooking so they even out.
5. When potatoes are done, add them back to a bowl (I like to use the same bowl from step 2 since there should be a little oil left in there) and add SALT and GARLIC
6. Enjoy!

# Ways to Cook Great Mushrooms

In our opinion, the best way to cook muchrooms is to 'dry' them first. This involves frying them in pan on medium heat with NO oil or butter, and waiting as they 'sweat' out their water. You'll have to monitor the heat to make sure it's hot enough for them to start sweating but not so hot that they will start toasting heavily or burning.

> The more dry you get them, the more they'll get rid of that mushy texture. With even more drying you can get to a 'bacon' like consistency.

# Some Awesome Products

- [Soy Curls](https://butlerfoods.com/soycurls.html): Freeze dried soy bean strips, with very minimal processing
    - Can usually be found at a Natural Foods Store or can be ordered online
    - Due to minimal processing, these are a bit better for you than other faux meats like TVP(Textured Vegtable Protein)
    - See best ways to cook them here: [Cooking Soy Curls](/recipes/soy_curls.md)
    - We buy them in bulk and store it in the freezer so we only buy it about once a year! If you like them you can nuy bulk through [Azure Standard](https://www.azurestandard.com/shop/search/soy%20curls) (I checked and they have a drop near your area.)
